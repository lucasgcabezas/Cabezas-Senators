                        <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                            transparency is
                            government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how
                            citizens hold
                            their
                            public
                            officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.</p>
                        <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public
                            business and spend
                            taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows
                            good and just
                            governance.
                            Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their
                            Government
                            is
                            doing.
                        </p>
                        <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                            Government's
                            effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
                            society, and
                            public
                            officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our
                            site to
                            become
                            actively
                            engaged in American government.</p>
                        <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We
                            solicit public
                            feedback
                            to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                <div class="my-2 ocultar" id="texto">

                    <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
                        opinion
                        dates
                        back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on
                        absolutist
                        doctrine
                        of
                        state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative
                        instruments
                        to
                        this
                        end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a
                        Swedish-governed
                        territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press
                        Act, 1766).
                        This
                        approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography
                        on the
                        eighteenth-century public sphere.

                    <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom
                        of the
                        press
                        enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press
                        in
                        constitutional
                        articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these
                        measures
                        were
                        vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and
                        Acton
                        prominent
                        among
                        the latter.</p>

                    <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is
                        often
                        linked
                        to
                        the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted
                        the
                        first
                        freedom
                        of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth
                        century and
                        Finland
                        continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
                        Publicity
                        of
                        Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>

                    <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                        Information Acts
                        (AIAs)
                        or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
